== Please raise your hand!

[options="step"]
* Who has ever used (or even tried to use) Eclipse to code in any programming language?
* Who has left Eclipse for another IDE?
* Who is working with large multi-module projects daily?

== Multi-module project in Eclipse (1/2)

Take GateIn Portal as a an example:
[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/gatein/gatein-portal
----
\... and import to Elipse as a bunch of Maven projects

== Multi-module project in Eclipse (2/2)

[frame="none",grid="none"]
|=========================================================
|While the file system hierarchy mirrors the logical structure of the modules|{nbsp}|
In Eclipse we are presented with a flat list of 109 projects ordered by artifactId

|=========================================================

//** To make it even worse, imagine that you want to import another related source tree with tens of modules...
//*** Eclipse mixes them luckily with what you have in your workspace
// and you end up with a mixed lists

== Workarounds

* Working sets
** One level only
** Only manually
** Does not scale when having many modules
* Naming conventions
** Name the modules so that they keep the file system order when ordered alphabetically
** Guaranteed to look stupid in front of IntelliJ and NetBeans users
* Use multiple workspaces to manage parts of a single source tree?

None of the above helps really

== The aim

This is what we want +
because this is how we think


//== The Proper Solution

//
//No, I will not be talking about
//switching to IntelliJ that has
//this for years ;)

== Because open source...

* Initiative taken by Mickeal Istria and Max Andersen from JBoss Tools team
* Started in jbosstools-playground repository under the name Nestor
* Technically astonishingly simple and elegant, using the available APIs of Project Manager

* Form the user perspective:
** New context menu in Project Explorer
** Backed by a persistent preference

== The happy end

* Meanwhile accepted for Eclipse Mars 4.5 M5 (to appear on 2015-02-06)
* Download and try it!
* https://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/Mars/

== Still missing

* No change in the Package Explorer
//** Package Explorer will once hopefully be merged into Project Explorer
* The same functionality in the Search View

== About me

* Primarily Senior Sustaining Engineer at Red Hat JBoss Portal
* Also contributing to several Eclipse plugins ShellEd, FreeMarker Editor, EIRCC
* My contribution to nested projects was minimal
